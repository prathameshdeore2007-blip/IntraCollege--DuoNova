### IntraCollege: Bridging the Campus Experience

"Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way." 

IntraCollege is a unified campus ecosystem designed to consolidate essential academic and administrative functions into a single, intuitive application. Developed by Team DuoNova, this platform addresses the daily struggles of a disconnected campus where students and faculty often juggle multiple, fragmented digital silos.
